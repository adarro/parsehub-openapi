# parsehub-openapi
Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation for ParseHub REST API

This is an implementation of a Swagger (OpenAPI 3) document of the [ParseHub](https://parsehub.com) REST api.

At current, the master document lives on SwaggerHub [HERE](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/adarro/parse-hub/0.0.1)

Github / Gitlab integration with SwaggerHub does not work for OpenAPI 3.0 at this time, but *should* in the near future.

## Versioning
I would like to follow Semantic Versioning [SemVer](https://semver.org/) but would like to keep this in sync with any Parsehub changes.

This project is Apache 2.0 Licensed, but use of ParseHub's services requires agreement to their [Terms of Service](https://www.parsehub.com/terms)
